    "Times New Roman",serif'>When your product team has access to the right
    technical documentation, they can make much quicker decisions. They don't have
    to scroll back through emails or threads in collaboration tools they can
    instead instantly consult the documents produced alongside the software that
    explain how everything works and records the reasoning behind the decisions.</span></p>

    "Times New Roman",serif'>When customers are using their software they can
    access your technical documentation alongside the product for help in using the
    tool. Documentation can be displayed in-app so customers don't have to switch
    context when they run into issues. This improves the overall usability and
    experience of your software product.<br>

    <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
    "Times New Roman",serif'>Having robust technical documentation makes it easier
    to advertise your product to potential customers. Many customers will be
    researching in more detail how your product works and technical documentation
    can explain your software features in more depth than you can get with typical
    marketing materials.</span></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
    "Times New Roman",serif'>When you have comprehensive technical documentation,
    customers can consult the docs when they run into technical issues. This
    reduces the number of inbound calls you get to your tech support line, and
    means you can support more customers on a smaller budget. Most customers prefer
    to troubleshoot problems themselves instead of waiting around for a person to

    make. Developers don't necessarily remember their ideas later on so your

    important technical documentation is to your capstone project or company
    project's overall success. It is an essential part of communication and means
    that members of your team don't literally have to be available every time
    someone has a question, whether that be a customer or a stakeholder from your
    team.</span></p>

    with a heavy heart if you follow the steps we've outlined in this guide then
    you'll be well on your way to creating content that is helpful for your users
    and the panelist on your defense. They'll be empowered to use your product and
    have more fun using it, which is exactly the goal of technical documentation.</span></p>
