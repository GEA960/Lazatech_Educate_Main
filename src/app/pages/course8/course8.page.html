<b>About version control and Git</b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history
of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As developers
make changes to the project, any earlier version of the project can be
recovered at any time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Developers can review project history to find out:<br>
Which changes were made?<br>
Who made the changes?<br>
When were the changes made?<br>
Why were changes needed?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>VCSs give each contributor a unified and consistent
view of a project, surfacing work that's already in progress. Seeing a
transparent history of changes, who made them, and how they contribute to the
development of a project helps team members stay aligned while working
independently.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>In a distributed version control system, every
developer has a full copy of the project and project history. Unlike once
popular centralized version control systems, DVCSs don't need a constant
connection to a central repository. Git is the most popular distributed version
control system. Git is commonly used for both open source and commercial
software development, with significant benefits for individuals, teams and
businesses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Git lets developers see the entire timeline of their
changes, decisions, and progression of any project in one place. From the
moment they access the history of a project, the developer has all the context
they need to understand it and start contributing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Developers work in every time zone. With a DVCS like
Git, collaboration can happen any time while maintaining source code integrity.
Using branches, developers can safely propose changes to production code.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Businesses using Git can break down communication
barriers between teams and keep them focused on doing their best work. Plus,
Git makes it possible to align experts across a business to collaborate on
major projects.<br>
<br>
<b>About repositories</b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>A repository, or Git project, encompasses the entire
collection of files and folders associated with a project, along with each
file's revision history. The file history appears as snapshots in time called
commits. The commits can be organized into multiple lines of development called
branches. Because Git is a DVCS, repositories are self-contained units and
anyone who has a copy of the repository can access the entire codebase and its
history. Using the command line or other ease-of-use interfaces, a Git
repository also allows for: interaction with the history, cloning the
repository, creating branches, committing, merging, comparing changes across
versions of code, and more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Through platforms like GitHub, Git also provides more
opportunities for project transparency and collaboration. Public repositories
help teams work together to build the best possible final product.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'><br>
<b>How GitHub works</b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>GitHub hosts Git repositories and provides developers
with tools to ship better code through command line features, issues (threaded
discussions), pull requests, code review, or the use of a collection of free
and for-purchase apps in the GitHub Marketplace. With collaboration layers like
the GitHub flow, a community of 15 million developers, and an ecosystem with
hundreds of integrations, GitHub changes the way software is built.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>GitHub builds collaboration directly into the
development process. Work is organized into repositories where developers can
outline requirements or direction and set expectations for team members. Then,
using the GitHub flow, developers simply create a branch to work on updates,
commit changes to save them, open a pull request to propose and discuss
changes, and merge pull requests once everyone is on the same page. For more
information, see &quot;</span><a

<b>GitHub and the command line</b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Basic Git commands</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>To use Git, developers use specific commands to copy,
create, change, and combine code. These commands can be executed directly from
the command line or by using an application like GitHub Desktop. Here are some
common commands for using Git:</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
     "Times New Roman",serif'>git init&nbsp;initializes a brand new Git
     repository and begins tracking an existing directory. It adds a hidden
     subfolder within the existing directory that houses the internal data structure
     required for version control.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
     "Times New Roman",serif'>git clone&nbsp;creates a local copy of a project
     that already exists remotely. The clone includes all the project's files,
     history, and branches.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
     "Times New Roman",serif'>git add&nbsp;stages a change. Git tracks changes
     to a developer's codebase, but it's necessary to stage and take a snapshot
     of the changes to include them in the project's history. This command
     performs staging, the first part of that two-step process. Any changes
     that are staged will become a part of the next snapshot and a part of the
     project's history. Staging and committing separately gives developers
     complete control over the history of their project without changing how
     they code and work.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
     "Times New Roman",serif'>git commit&nbsp;saves the snapshot to the project
     history and completes the change-tracking process. In short, a commit
     functions like taking a photo. Anything that's been staged with&nbsp;git
     add&nbsp;will become a part of the snapshot with&nbsp;git commit.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
     "Times New Roman",serif'>git status&nbsp;shows the status of changes as
     untracked, modified, or staged.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
     "Times New Roman",serif'>git branch&nbsp;shows the branches being worked
     on locally.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
     "Times New Roman",serif'>git merge&nbsp;merges lines of development
     together. This command is typically used to combine changes made on two
     distinct branches. For example, a developer would merge when they want to
     combine changes from a feature branch into the main branch for deployment.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
     "Times New Roman",serif'>git pull&nbsp;updates the local line of
     development with updates from its remote counterpart. Developers use this
     command if a teammate has made commits to a branch on a remote, and they
     would like to reflect those changes in their local environment.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
     "Times New Roman",serif'>git push&nbsp;updates the remote repository with
     any commits made locally to a branch.</span></li>
